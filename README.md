# Task Whisper

In this repository, you will find my app, Task Whisper, which I am developing as a "Daily Todo App." The main idea is to track my routine tasks that I need to complete every day. I also want to create a reward system (maybe something like RPG leveling?) and implement smart notifications based on when the user previously completed tasks.

Note: This app is made for Android devices. Because of Flutter it is likely that you could run this app on any other devices, but for now I am developing only for Android.
